## ⚠️ **KNOWN ISSUES & FIXES**

### **Issue: "Could not fetch HS code suggestions"**
- **Reason:** Google AI API key not set or quota exceeded
- **Impact:** HS code auto-suggestions don't work (optional feature)
- **Fix:** 
  - Get free Google AI key: https://ai.google.dev/
  - Set in Supabase: Edge Functions → `get-hs-code` → Secrets → `API_KEY`
  - Or I can disable this feature if you don't need it

### **Issue: "Form not responding"**
- **Fix 1:** Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- **Fix 2:** Verify dist/ was uploaded correctly
- **Fix 3:** Check browser console for errors

### **Issue: "Function not found"**
- **Reason:** Edge Functions not deployed in Supabase
- **Fix:** Verify in Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions:
  - `shippo-proxy` shows as "Active"
  - `sea-rates-proxy` shows as "Active"
