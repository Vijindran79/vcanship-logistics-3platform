## üéØ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

Even services with AI should email you so you can:
- Follow up with real quotes from partners
- Build customer relationships
- Track conversion rates

### Priority 2: Upgrade Mock Services
**Vehicle Shipping** and **Inland Trucking** should:
1. Use Google Gemini AI for better estimates
2. Send email notifications to you
3. Store user data for follow-up

### Priority 3: Complete Missing Services
**FCL** and **Air Freight** need:
1. Full implementation with Google Gemini AI
2. Email capture system
3. User-friendly quote forms

## üìß EMAIL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

For ALL services, capture:
- ‚úÖ User contact info (name, email, phone)
- ‚úÖ Complete shipment details
- ‚úÖ Generated AI estimate
- ‚úÖ Timestamp
- ‚úÖ Service type

Send to: YOUR_EMAIL@vcanship.com

This allows you to:

2. Convert AI estimates to real bookings
3. Build customer database
4. Track which services need partner APIs

I can do all of this without breaking any existing code!
